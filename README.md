# TimSort Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of the TimSort algorithm in C language using doubly linked list.

# What is TimSort?
Timsort is a hybrid, stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It was implemented by Tim Peters in 2002 for use in the Python programming language. The algorithm finds subsequences of the data that are already ordered (runs) and uses them to sort the remainder more efficiently. This is done by merging runs until certain criteria are fulfilled. Timsort has been Python's standard sorting algorithm since version 2.3. It is also used to sort arrays of non-primitive type in Java SE 7,[4] on the Android platform,[5] in GNU Octave,[6] on V8,[7] Swift,[8] and Rust.[9]

## How to run

```First, clone the repository: git clone && cd timsort```

```Then, run the following commands: make && ./timsort.exe```

## How to use

```To use the algorithm, you need to create a list of integers and pass it to the function timsort()```

```Example:```

```int list[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};```

```tim_sort(list);```
